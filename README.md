# Simon Game
So this is the first ever dymanic project i have done with frontend javascript. I was still learning at the time I made this project and took help from a few sources. I am happy to share the progress here with you.

I added sounds to the game upon button pressing and gameover sound when the player loses the game. All the sound files are available in the sounds folder.
